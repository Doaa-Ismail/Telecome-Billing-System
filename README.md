# Telecome-Billing-System
Design Simple functions have been used in co-ordination with data structure and file handling. As the 
project is relatively short, you can thoroughly go through the whole source code; this will help 
you understand data structure and file handling if you know their fundamentals. The functions 
and features used in this project are listed below: 
  1- Add new records: add new data into file with name, phone number and amount to be paid 
  2- View list of records – lists all telephone billing records 
  3- Modify records – edit the added records; name, phone number and/or amount of payment can be edited 
  4- View payment – shows amount to be paid 
  5- Search records – search for added/updated records in file 
  6- Delete records – removes data permanently from file 
  7- Record a complain- write a comment customer complaining
